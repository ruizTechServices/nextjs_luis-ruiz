It means that in your `app/page.js`, whenever you hit

```jsx
{activeTab === "text_to_speech" && <TextToSpeech />}
```

the `TextToSpeech` identifier doesn’t exist—Next.js can’t find a component or variable by that name in scope. In plain terms: you’re trying to render `<TextToSpeech />`, but you never imported or defined `TextToSpeech` in this file (or you’ve got a typo).

**Steps to verify and fix:**

1. **Check for an import**
   At the top of `app/page.js`, you should have something like:

   ```js
   import TextToSpeech from "@/components/TextToSpeech";
   ```

   or wherever your component actually lives. If you forgot this line, the JSX reference will throw exactly that “not defined” error.

2. **Confirm the component’s filename and export**

   * Open the file where you wrote your TextToSpeech logic (e.g., `components/TextToSpeech.js` or `app/text-to-speech/page.js`).
   * Make sure it has a default (or named) export:

     ```js
     // components/TextToSpeech.js
     export default function TextToSpeech() {
       return <div>…</div>;
     }
     ```
   * If you exported it as a named export (e.g., `export function TextToSpeech() {…}`), then your import must match:

     ```js
     import { TextToSpeech } from "@/components/TextToSpeech";
     ```

3. **Verify the path is correct**
   Sometimes people put it under `components/` but accidentally import from the wrong folder. Double-check the relative path (or alias) points exactly to where `TextToSpeech` lives.

4. **Watch out for misspellings or casing**
   If your file is called `textToSpeech.js` but you import `TextToSpeech`, macOS/Windows might not catch it, but a deployment on Linux (case-sensitive) will. Make sure the file and import names match exactly.

5. **Restart the dev server after renaming/moving files**
   Occasionally a hot-reload misses a moved component. Stopping `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`) and starting again can clear up stale references.

**If you’re still stuck**:

* Show me the very top of `app/page.js` (the import section).
* Point out where the `TextToSpeech` component is defined—file name, export style, folder structure.
* That way, we can spot mismatches or typos.

**TL;DR:**
Your code is trying to render `<TextToSpeech />`, but there’s no `TextToSpeech` imported or declared in scope. Make sure you have the correct import statement (matching file path, name, and export) at the top of `app/page.js`.
