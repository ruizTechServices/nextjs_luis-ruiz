I want to include more information about myself. THis is a website for a portfolio for me, Luis Ruiz. 
I already have my projects displayed. I already have my skills displayed. I have to modify the way the 
skills look cause it looks all messy and shit.
I want to add more appeasement to the context of each website in my projects section. I want to add a 
plethora of project in the project section. Even if it is half-assed, I want people to check on the status of my projects, etc. 

I want to add detailed descriptions to the websites in the projects section, and I want to modify 
the AI section to look similar to the projects section. 

I want to add more to the project section.
