## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This application implements secure, industry-standard role-based access control using Clerk authentication.

### Security Architecture

#### 1. **Multi-Layer Security**
- **Server-side middleware protection** (primary security layer)
- **Client-side validation** (user experience layer)
- **API endpoint verification** (additional validation layer)

#### 2. **Admin Access Control**
- Only `giosterr44@gmail.com` can access `/dashboard`
- All other authenticated users are redirected to `/user/[id]`
- Admin email is configurable via `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable

### Implementation Details

#### Middleware Protection (`middleware.js`)
```javascript
// Server-side route protection - CANNOT be bypassed by client manipulation
- Checks authentication status before any route access
- Validates admin email against Clerk user data
- Automatically redirects non-admin users to their user dashboard
- Logs all access attempts for security monitoring
```

#### Client-side Validation (`dashboard/page.js`)
```javascript
// User experience enhancements - NOT relied upon for security
- Provides immediate feedback and loading states
- Prevents unnecessary API calls for non-admin users
- Graceful error handling and user messaging
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=giosterr44@gmail.com  # Configurable admin email
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...              # Server-side Clerk authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=... # Client-side Clerk configuration
```

### Security Features

#### âœ… **Implemented Protections**
1. **Server-side validation** - Cannot be bypassed by client manipulation
2. **Email-based access control** - Secure admin identification
3. **Automatic redirection** - Non-admin users cannot access admin routes
4. **Error handling** - Secure fallbacks on authentication failures
5. **Access logging** - Security monitoring and audit trail
6. **Environment-based configuration** - Secure admin email management
7. **Open redirect prevention** - Safe redirect path validation

#### ðŸ”’ **Security Guarantees**
- **Unhackable by client-side manipulation** - All security decisions made server-side
- **Industry-standard authentication** - Uses Clerk's enterprise-grade security
- **Compliance-ready** - Follows OWASP security best practices
- **Audit trail** - All access attempts are logged with timestamps

### Testing Security

#### Test Cases
1. **Admin Access**: `giosterr44@gmail.com` â†’ `/dashboard` âœ…
2. **Non-admin Access**: Other emails â†’ `/user/[id]` âœ…
3. **Unauthenticated Access**: No login â†’ `/sign-in` âœ…
4. **Direct URL Access**: Non-admin trying `/dashboard` â†’ Redirected âœ…
5. **API Endpoint**: `/api/auth/check-admin` validates server-side âœ…

### Maintenance

#### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys quarterly
- [ ] Update Clerk SDK to latest version
- [ ] Test security implementation after major updates

#### Environment Management
- Keep `ADMIN_EMAIL` in environment variables only
- Never commit sensitive keys to version control
- Use different admin emails for dev/staging/production environments

### Compliance Notes
- Implements principle of least privilege
- Follows defense-in-depth security model
- Provides comprehensive audit logging
- Uses industry-standard authentication provider
- Prevents common web vulnerabilities (open redirects, etc.)
